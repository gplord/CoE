Barton (1990, pp. 67–70) contrasts Plautus’s careful use of names with Sh.’s nearly systematic failure to make anything of them: To turn from the Menaechmi to The Comedy of Errors is to exchange onomastic neatness and lucidity for opacity, and also a measure of contradiction. . . . The names he chose throughout, a mixture of Greek, Latin, English, Semitic, and Italian, all of them functioning as praenomen, are, on the whole, uncommunicative. . . . Attempts to establish the literary or other origins of the names . . . tend to be . . . unhelpful, not because antecedents cannot be found, but because there are too many of them, and—given the arbitrary way names are attached to particular individuals—little possibility of determining the original context. . . . In the Menaechmi, names had not only been expressive, but an integral part of the selfhood of their bearers. . . . Shakespeare’s interest in what might be called the psychology of names—how people use and feel about their own and those of other people—was to become something that not even Ben Jonson in the period could rival. In this particular early comedy, however, for whatever reason, it is a concern striking only by its absence.</p>  "},

Gray notes that Proteus also figures in another early play, TGV. Baldwin (1947, pp. 685–6) quotes Cooper’s (1565) account of Aegeus, father of Theseus, who drowned himself after Theseus, having killed the Minotaur, returned home by sea, forgetting that his black sail meant his death; the sea was thereafter called Aegeum: Here was a name with sufficiently tragic connections to be bestowed upon this unhappy parent. Baldwin does not, nor does anyone else, notice that at the top of Cooper’s page (fol. Aiiiv of the Dictionarium Historicum) is the entry on Aegæon, a son of Titan and Terra who threw rocks at his father and was bound with an hundred chaynes to the rockes of the sea Aegæum.

Antipholus, the usual spelling in F1, has caused trouble because it is etymologically wrong. It ought to be Antiphilos or Antiphilus, a name for a lover derived from Greek ἀντιφιλἰα, mutual affection (Lloyd in Singer, ed. 1856, 4:81). The problem is compounded because the name is spelled Antipholis the first three times it appears (162, 273, and 394) by Compositors C and D, but after—in order of printing—each spelled it Antipholus (617, 786, and thereafter). Eds. since Malone (ed. 1790) have settled on Antipholus because Capell (1774, sig. U4v) emended ruinate (790) to ruinous: Which suggested the true and right name, at least as far as the -us ending is concerned. Baldwin (1947, p. 696) sensibly believes that Sh. wanted a significant name, i.e., one that characterized its bearer: So the name Antiphilus was doubtless calculated to give the impression of a nice young lover, as each of the brothers is supposed to be; his archness betrays him—see Altman below. Baldwin thinks that Antipho- results from Sh.’s finding the name in Terence’s Phormio: When from memory he [Sh.] attempted to turn it [Antiphila, a female in Terence’s Self-Tormenter] into the masculine, Antipho got in the way to produce first the intended-to-be-Greek form Antipholis, which then became the equally intended-to-be Latin form Antipholus. If this process indeed produced the garbled name, it argues against Sh.’s being a schoolmaster before he came to London at the beginning of his career, for schoolmasters should not make such mistakes. Baldwin is followed by Riehle (1990, pp. 177–8). Bullough (1957, 1:9): In Sidney’s Arcadia Lib. 2 Antiphilus, beloved by Erona and rescued by her from prison, falls in love with someone else. When King he justifies polygamy and is slain by women. Perhaps Shakespeare was thinking ironically of this when he had to name his henpecked and not-very-faithful or affectionate Citizen. But Sh. had to name the Syracusan brother as well; the irony would have been at best half appropriate. Sidney’s Antiphilus is, as well, low-bred and something of a coward who only unwillingly joins Pyrocles and Musidorus in personal combat, getting himself captured. E. Antipholus was a brave warrior (1666–70). Altman (1978, p. 166 n.): Willichius etymologizes the name Antipho, which is the apparent source of . . . Antipholus, as follows: [Αντἰφων] reluctans & renitens, semper contrarius, ab [ἀντὶ] & [φἀων] (Terence <1567>, cited by Baldwin, p. 696). Baldwin does not believe this is the source of the name, arguing that it derives from Antiphila, one who returns love, but this does not characterize the behavior of the brothers, which is reluctans and renitens, at least that of E. Antipholus. Garton (1979, p. 237) proposes that Sh. knew of a centaur named Pholus in Metamorphoses 12.306, which he combined with another centaur, Antimachus (12.406): The anti- served a double purpose. First, it meant that each twin was counterpart to a Pholus, that is, counterpart to a centaur and having symbolical affinities with one; second, it meant that each twin is reciprocal to a centaur, i.e., reciprocal to the other twin. His proposal is met with approval by Truax (1992, p. 35) and Brown (1998, p. 180), who proposes a pun on Pholus-phallus to make up for Sh.’s not using Plautus’ bawdy Peniculus.</p>    <p>Baldwin (1947, p. 695) finds that 16th-c. editors had derived Plautus’s Menechmus from Greek ἀιχμἠ (spear point), so Menechmus meant bellator, warrior. Baldwin very obliquely hints that this gloss influences the presentation of E. Antipholus as a former soldier (1666–70): and this warrior idea is evidently the significance which attaches to the corresponding character in The Comedy. It is an attractive possibility nowhere else remarked on.</p>    <p>Unlikely interpretations include Wordsworth (1864, p. 96 n.): [Perhaps] the name . . . is a mistake (on the part of author or printer) for Amphibolus . . . i.e. ambiguous, doubtful. Feldman (1955, p. 117): Antifollies, since, he says, Err. is the product of Sh.’s recognition that his marriage was a disaster.

To the boy who was left at home his paternal grandfather gave the name of the stolen [surrepticii], calling him Menaechmus instead of Sosicles. . . .

Whencesoever Shakespeare adopted erraticus and surreptus (which either he or his editors have mis-spelt) these distinctions were soon dropt. Capell (1774, p. 71) thinks Sereptus indicates that Sh. read Plautus’s Latin, but he does not explain just what Sh. looked at to get the name. Glover (in Clark & Wright, ed. 1863, 1:462): Plainly derived from Plautus’ Menæchmus Surreptus, a well-known character in Shakespeare’s day: see Brian Melbancke’s Philotimus (158[3], p. 160): Thou art like Menechmus Subreptus his wife.

Others suppose that the identifier somehow is influenced by Plautus’s Erotium, the courtesan. Hertzberg (ed. 1870, 8:192) proposes that someone (not Sh.) lightly acquainted with Latin noticed that Erotium enters to the visiting Menaechmus in 1.3, who is not identified by his identifier (Beiname) in the stage direction (he is already on stage), and that the person made a strained etymological connection with errare to produce Errotis and Erotes. Anders (1904, p. 33): Erotes looks like a compromise between Erotium . . . and Sosicles, the surname of the other Menæchmus. Baldwin (1947, p. 697) thinks it likely that Erotium lies behind the identifier (Shakspere could have intended his Erotes to mean the lover . . . the Antiphilus who fell in love, silently abandoning his theory of ed. 1928, p. 105: Shakespeare is merely following up his error idea . . . and intends his title to mean the mistaken one. The word Errotis, I take it, is Erratus, the u being changed for i, just as Antipholus frequently [sic: three times] is spelled Antipholis. The o was also substituted for a, either through misreading or similarity of sound. Cooper [1565] defines Erratus as That hath [ben] wand[r]ed or strayed in . . . .

Riehle (1990, p. 182): If an exorcist wants to expell evil spirits from the human being in whom they dwell, he has to pinch them in return, and therefore Dr Pinch’s name suggests part of his activity as an exorcist; he quotes 587. Gurr (1996, p. 280) doubts that any parts were written for Sincler before the establishment of the Chamberlain’s men in 1594, but (privately) grants that the uncertain dating of Err. makes it possible that Sh. had Sincler in mind.

She is unnamed in Gower’s version in Confessio Amantis, Book 8, called there only some version of the king’s daughter or wife. Some commentators erroneously say that Lucina is named in Gower.

She is called Kitchin wench (886) and Kitchen maide (1360), but some commentators call her cook without authority. Foakes (ed. 1962, p. xxv): The courtesan’s maid and cook [in Menaechmi] are transferred to the wife, and changed into Luce, . . . and Nell, and in n., These are assimilated into one figure towards the end of the play . . . but the two names . . . may reveal Shakespeare’s first thought of taking over into his play both the maid and a figure corresponding to the cook, Cylindrus. Bland (ed. Gesta Grayorum, 1968, pp. 94–5) thinks Luce may refer to Luce Morgan, a notorious brothel keeper mentioned in Gesta Grayorum: I would like to suggest that Nell, who is called swart at [893], was temporarily renamed Luce for the occasion of the play’s performance at Gray’s Inn because Lucy Negro Morgan is mentioned as one of the Prince’s [i.e., of Purpoole, the mock prince of the Gray’s Inn revels] followers, and that the name remained in the script. The exchange between Luce and the party at the door is bawdy enough to warrant the change of the name at this point. Commentators divide on whether she is E. Dromio’s wife or his intended. The first group, e.g., Gaw (Sincklo, 1926, p. 627); Gill (1930, pp. 45, 51); Muir (1957 and 1977, p. 16); Levin (ed. 1965, p. xxxii); Bonazza (1966, p. 36); Leary (1977, p. 46), takes S.

Baldwin (ed. 1928, p. 120, n. 3; 1947, pp. 691–2) believes that Sh. was influenced by Dionysius Lambinus’s edition of Plautus (1576), which marks each succeeding mistaken identity in the margin with some version of Latin error (n.) or errare (vb.), e.g., Hic sunt erroris initia (Here the errors begin): Naturally then, this comedy of Menæchmi was to Shakespeare, or to any one else using the edition of Lambinus, The Comedy of Errors.

MacLean (1972, p. 30): The primary meaning of error in Shakespeare’s time . . . was the action of roaming or wandering (O.E.D.); to recognize this is to notice Shakespeare’s insistent employment in the opening and concluding scenes of the play (but also intermittently throughout the action) of terms and images associated with travel, particularly nautical and marine imagery. . . .  It seems . . . that [such] images . . . trace a movement from restless and unfulfilled search, shipwreck, and a doubtfull warrant of immediate death ([71]) to the harmonious concord of the final scene. See 194, 825, 1225. Sh. plays on the meaning in Hamlet 1.1.154 (153), th’extrauagant, and erring Spirit. The sense of wandering may seem too obvious, for it is seldom remarked on.</p>  "},

Upton (1746; 1748, pp. 323–4 n.): Sh. calls Ephesus the land of conjurors and witches.

Capell (1774, p. 71) on 262–8: The character given of Ephesians in this place is the very same that it had with the ancients, which may pass for some note of the Poet’s learning. Douce (1807, 2:289): In the ancient city of Ephesus we have ducats, marks, and guilders, and the abbess of a nunnery. Mention is also made of several modern European kingdoms, and of America; of Henry the Fourth of France, of Turkish tapestry, a rapier, and a striking clock; of Lapland sorcerers, Satan, and even of Adam and Noah. In one place Antipholis calls himself a Christian. As we are unacquainted with the immediate source whence this play was derived, it is impossible to ascertain whether Shakspeare is responsible for these anachronisms. Knight (ed. 1842, pp. 135–6), against Douce: The poets of Shakspere’s time had no hesitation in placing the fables of the romantic ages in classical localities, leaving the periods and the names perfectly undefined and unappreciable. Lloyd (in Singer, ed. 1856, 2:82) considers why Sh. changed the locale from Epidamnus to Ephesus, commenting on 264–8: The description is in accordance with various classical notices of Ephesian practice, but inasmuch as it is still more so with the account in the Acts of the Apostles of the exorcists in that city, Jewish and other, we . . . see at least the poet’s motive for transferring [Err.] to a locality where such would most alarm and bewilder, and professors of exorcism like . . . Pinch, be within call traditionally; the play upon the name of Epidamnum, was necessarily lost in translation (i.e., The verie name shews the nature, no man comes hither sine damno [without harm] [Menaechmi, tr. 1595; see ]). Porter & Clarke (ed. 1903): One of the twelve Ionian cities, on the south bank of the Castrus, said to be named from one of the Amazons; celebrated as the seat of worship of Artemis [Diana], and also for the founding there by Paul of a Christian church. There has been some discussion . . . as to whether in Shakespeare’s play we have pagan Ephesus or Christian Ephesus. As the play is full of allusions which belong to Elizabethan England, the wisest conclusion is to regard it as an Ephesus which existed only in the poet’s fancy. Modern commentators beginning with Bullough (1957, 1: 9–10) emphasize the thematic advantages of referring to the Epistle to the Ephesians, with its call for obedience of wives to husbands, and servants to masters, as well as other matters pertinent to this play. Foakes (ed. 1962, pp. xxix f.): One motive in changing the scene to Ephesus may have been to give the play a setting more familiar to a London audience, for Ephesus was known not only through the Bible, but as a seaport, and the home of a famous temple of Diana. So, in The Excellent and pleasant Works of Julius Solinus Polyhistor (1587 [Arthur Golding’s trans. of a 3rd-c. AD book]), Shakespeare might have read of Asia Minor that it was enclosed on the [W]est wyth the Aeg[æ]an Sea. . . .  In it is the most famous Cittie Ephesus. The beauty of Ephesus is the Temple of Diana, buylded by the Am[o]zons. There is no evidence that Shakespeare did read this book, but he probably knew of Solinus, whose name he gave to the Duke. Gray (1927, p. 108) first calls attention to Golding’s translation and the Duke’s name. Cantrell (privately) points out that the River Cayster, which had provided the harbor for Ephesus, had been silted in since at least AD 1500; Foss (1979, p. 168): The record of sixteenth-century Ephesus is almost blank, and when information is again available, the flourishing commercial town had declined to become a village which constantly fell further into ruin and squalor. . . .  The remaining harbor was silted and trade shifted to Izmir and Scalanova. . . .  The swamps produced by the silting were no longer drained and gave rise to malaria. Bullough, like Foakes, calls it a seaport, but neither Solinus nor Cooper (1565) mentions Ephesus’s much earlier fame as a port and mercantile city. Commentators, beginning with Wislicenus (1879, p. 94), sometimes remark that Gower’s queen is cast ashore at Ephesus in Apollonius of Tyre. It cannot be made certain whether Acts, Eph., or Gower first suggested the change in locale.</p>  "},

Commentators vary in their sympathy for the length of this exposition. Gentleman (ed. 1774): Few authors . . . could have told Egeon’s long story in so easy a flow of natural expression . . . ; notwithstanding one hundred and three lines of narration are assigned . . . even decently recited, they must please. Draper (1961, p. 28): The whole is an arid stretch of merely rhetorical monologue occasionally broken by a comment of the Duke. . . .  Those who arrived in time heard a tedious brief introduction; and those who were late would not understand the fundamental fact of two sets of twins and so would lose the point of the comedy. Berry (1965, pp. 41–2): [His] narration is utterly flat and colorless . . . because of the near absence of variation and tone, because of the absence of vivid realization . . . and because of the near absence of variation of tense and grammatical construction. Yet the speech economically covers a complicated history. Shakespeare’s expository skill here is as striking as is his poetic and dramatic dullness. He points out that Egeon tells his story without mentioning a single personal name. Barton (in Evans, ed. 1974, p. 80): The speech is faintly absurd. A family of six scattered by Fortune in a fashion at once so implausible and so ingeniously patterned announces itself fairly clearly as material for a comedy resolution. Yet it is wrong for actors to make Egeon’s explanation to the Duke overtly comic. The anguish of the old man is real, even if the verse he speaks suggests delicately to a theatre audience that his loss will not prove irremediable. Bergeron (1980, p. 113): The problem is not just length—some 158 lines—but that Egeon speaks 107 of the lines. He does a 90-line stretch, interrupted only once by the Duke, who perversely urges: do not break off so [99]—the Duke is no friend of theatre! Evans (1960, pp. 2–5) and Scragg (1988, p. 63) emphasize how the exposition permits the theater audience to know what no one on stage knows, that there are two sets of identical twins. Sider (1973, p. 1) adds that Egeon’s uncertain fate sustains curiosity when our interest might flag because the unravelling of a plot based on mistaken identity is so singularly predictable. Huston (1981, pp. 20–1): Egeon is not an altogether reliable narrator. . . .  He sometimes jumbles the particulars of these events, and his interpretation of their meaning is often misleading. Schlüter (1958, pp. 109 ff.) accounts for what he takes as Egeon’s weak expository speech in grammatical terms: too many passive verbs; use of the pluperfect tense, which makes the account static; too much modifying of nouns; and the like. He calls this an epic style, not a dramatic one.

Idem (1879, p. 18): And then the accident which divided the mast in twain, is so managed by the dramatist as to allow of some latitude in construing the mode in which the two sets of persons are saved; thus, when we afterwards find that it was the elder son who escaped with the mother, and the younger son with the father, there is no violation of consistency. Moreover, eldest here bears the sense of most important, first needing attention. Baldwin (ed. 1928, p. 103): In the Menæchmi, it is father’s son who goes to Tarentum and gets lost. Naturally, Shakespeare thinks of him as the elder, though the distinction itself comes from Amphitruo, where the twins are born at one birth, although Amphitruo’s son is a ten-month’s child, Jupiter’s seven. But in Shakespeare, because of the changed device for the separation, it is mother’s boy who gets lost, and father’s who stays at home. Hence to the time of the shipwreck, they remain as in Plautus; but thereafter they get exchanged.

Idem (Genetics, 1965, p. 104) changes his mind: Shakspere has in fact combined the Erot- of Erotium and the masculine ending -es of Sosicles. . . .  This is essentially the solution suggested by Anders [1904, p. 33], who had been anticipated by Hertzberg [ed. 1870, 8:188–94]. . . .

Kolin (p. 6): The name of this inn resonates with portent about Ephesus’s reputation [for dark magic]. . . .  The history of the mythic beast signals the transformations that Antipholus himself will experience in Ephesus. (The centaurs burst in upon Pirithous’s marriage and carried off his bride and ravished her.) When he is mistaken for his married twin brother . . .

Whether the audience at the earliest performances of [Err.] did or did not associate Dromio’s lines with Balthazar’s [in Spanish Tragedy]—and the popularity of Kyd’s play makes it likely that some of them could have done so—they can hardly have been unaware of the element of burlesque that the rhetorical figure brings with it when the speaker is a servant and the subject a dinner that is growing cold. Wells (ed. 1972, p. 21): The [adagio] pace [of S. Antipholus’s preceding speech] changes to a brisk allegro with the clattering entry of the Ephesian Dromio, whose blank verse, with its end-stopped lines, its largely monosyllabic diction, its rhythmic regularity, and its staccato sound effects (line [208] onwards), contrasts with the melancholy enjambements and long vowels of Antipholus’s lament.</p>  "},

And they are plainly distinguished from the witches, as the epithet given these last implies that they work by compact with the Devil, which the epithet under consideration [Drug-working] doth not. Johnson (ed. 1765): Perhaps the epithets have been only misplaced, and the lines should read thus, Soul killing sorcerers . . . Dark-working witches. . . .  By soul-killing I understand destroying the rational faculties by such means as make men fancy themselves beasts. Steevens (ed. 1773): Witches or sorcerers themselves, as well as those who employed them, were supposed to forfeit their souls by making use of a forbidden agency. In that sense, they may be said to destroy the souls of others as well as their own. Steevens (ed. 1778) compares Warner’s 1595 translation: For this assure your selfe, this Towne Epidamnum, is a place of outragious expences, exceeding in all ryot and lasciuiousnesse: and (I heare) as full of Ribaulds, Parasites, Drunkards, Catchpoles, Cony-catchers, and Sycophants, as it can hold: then for Curtizans (see ). Rann (ed. 1786): That destroy the souls of their employers, and forfeit their own. Baldwin (ed. 1928 and Genetics, 1965, pp. 37–8) distinguishes among conjurer, sorcerer, and witch following the law of 5 Elizabeth 16 agaynst Conjurac̄ons Inchantements and Witche craftes, quoting with slight variations Minsheu (1617): Coniuration in the Common Law is vsed for such as haue personall conference with the Diuell or euill spirit, to know any secret, or effect any purpose. . . .  And the difference between Coniuration and Witchcraft, is, that the Coniurer seemeth by praiers and inuocation of Gods powerfull names, to compell the Diuell to say or doe what he commandeth him: The Witch dealeth rather by a friendly and voluntarie conference or agreement betweene him or her and the Diuell or Familiar. . . .  So that a Coniurer compacts for curiositie to know secrets, and worke maruels; and the Witch of mere malice to doe mischiefe: And both these differ from Inchaunters or Sorcerers, because the former two haue personall conference with the Diuell, and the other meddles but with Medicines and ceremoniall formes of words called Charmes, without apparition.

[Warner also substitutes chain for bracelet] for no apparent reason unless it be whim, or an echo of Shakespeare. Foakes (ed. 1962): This is probably a coincidence, and due to the popular fashion of the time of wearing chains of gold or jewels round the neck (see [Macquoid in] Shakespeare’s England, II: 115–17), as well as to the greater prominence of a chain on stage; cf. [1474], where Antipholus of Syracuse comes on stage wearing it. (OED, sb.1 3).

Wells (ed. 1972): Presumably the general sense is either I would not mind if he kept that (the chain) or I wish that he would keep his love to himself. Since none of the proposed alterations seems satisfactory, F’s reading is preferred here, awkward though it is, in the possibility that it is intended to mean Would that he kept his (other) love to himself provided that. . . .  Dorsch (ed. 1988), reading a love him: It is tempting to suppose that the compositor was disposed to set up he would detain by the parallel with he would keep in the following line. The two lines would then mean, Would that only a love-affair kept him from me, provided that he kept on good terms with his (legitimate) wife. This may be awkward, but it is no more so than the alternatives so far proposed. But if Adriana is willing to allow adultery, why is she jealous, 376–81, or why would she die weeping (391)?  (2) Explanations of F2 alone, alone: Collier (ed. 1842): I wish he would only detain from me the chain alone. The Clarkes (1879, p. 660): A marked peculiarity in Shakespeare’s style is the fearless mode in which he frequently repeats the same word or words in a line, phrase or speech; thereby giving an emphatic effect to the passage, citing many passages including Luc. 795, But I alone, alone must sit and pine, and Jn. 3.1.170 (1097). Porter & Clarke (ed. 1903), sensibly: It is simply an example of a misprint common in F of a turned letter.  (3) Various emendations; see textual note and Unadopted Conjectures. The defenses of the emendations range from the fairy tale to the plausible. Knight (ed. 1842): The meaning is—I would the chain alone would detain his love—hold his love to me: Would that alone his love it would detain. Cuningham (ed. 1907): o’love, i.e. of love, of all love; for love’s sake; possibly with reference to keep fair quarter in the next line, comparing MND 2.2.154 (809), and other examples of of all loves. Stewart (1914, pp. 238–9): The love referred to is the chain itself . . . a love token. . . .  Would that a love[-token] alone were all that he would detain from me. Kellner (1925, §114C), l misprinted for t: I suggest a toy, referring . . . to the promised chain. Foakes (ed. 1962), crediting Kellner: toie is close enough to loue in secretary hand for confusion to be possible, since a looped t may easily look like l (cf. lime for time, H8, V.i.37 [2815]), and minim letters are rarely clear. Wilson (ed. 1962): Kellner . . . conjectures attractively alone a toy—with toie misread loue.

Mr. Pope, who pretends to have collated the first Folio, should have spar’d us the Lines, at least, in their Corruption.—I communicated my doubts upon this Passage to my Friend Mr. Warburton; and to his Sagacity I owe, in good part, the Correction of it. The Sense of the whole is now very pertinent; which, without the two Lines from the first Folio, was very imperfect; not to say, ridiculous. The Comparison is fully Closed. Gold, indeed, bides handling well; but, for all that, often Touching will wear even Gold: So, no Man of a great Character, even as pure as Gold, but may in Time lose it by Falsehood and Corruption. Warburton (ed. 1747): [As Theobald, then] just so the greatest character, tho’ as pure as gold itself, may, in time, be injured, by the repeated attacks of falsehood and corruption. Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821): Wear is used as a dissyllable. See the Essay on Shakspeare’s Metre. The commentator last mentioned [Steevens], not perceiving this, reads—and so no man &c. . . .  The observation concerning gold is found in . . . [Richard Edwards] Damon and Pithias, 1582: —gold in time does wear away, And other precious things do fade: friendship does ne’er decay. Irving & Marshall (ed. 1888; see Unadopted Conjectures 388–9): The man who is the jewel of her love, will lose his beauty, i.e. the many charms with which her love had invested him; yet the gold, i.e. the setting of the jewel, the real man, bides (remains) still. The jewel, being enamelled, would not be a precious stone, and therefore of less intrinsic value than the gold setting. The other three lines, which are manifestly corrupt, might then read thus:  That others touch, and often touching will Wear gold; so any man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame;  in which case the only alterations of the original text would be in the punctuation; and the substitution of wear for where, and so any for and no (the and having very likely been copied from the line above. The meaning of touch may be to assay [OED, v. 8a] or to defile [OED, v. 2a]. But, in any case, the author seems to have neglected to carry out the simile he originally intended. Herford (ed. 1899): The best enamelled jewel tarnishes; but the gold setting keeps its lustre however it may be worn by the touch; similarly, a man of assured reputation, can commit domestic infidelity without blasting it [i.e., his reputation]. Cuningham (ed. 1907, pp. 125–7): The exact meaning of this vexed and difficult passage—difficult owing to the concise expression of the simile intended, and the necessities of the verse—may perhaps be most clearly arrived at by a formal tabular analysis of its several terms [he uses parallel columns]; those in italics showing the terms Shakespeare does not express and leaves to the comprehension of his hearers. . . .   [Col. 1] I see the best enamelled jewel (e.g. a ring) Will lose its beauty (by the wearing of the enamel); Yet the gold (setting), That others touch, (And, in fact, often touching will cause the gold to wear) Still remains gold; <And just as no gold (setting) well enamelled is spoilt by the wear of the enamel>  [Col. 2] I find the man (husband) best endowed with moral qualities Will lose these qualities (by temptation); Yet the real man (husband), That other women tempt, (And frequent temptation will corrupt him in the end) Still remains one’s husband; So no man of assured reputation is shamed by his falsehood and corruption.</p>    <p>Since, therefore, my husband’s reputation is unassailable, and my beauty has faded and ceased to please him, I have no resource but to weep and die. . . . </p>    <p>Some authorities take gold to mean gold coin; touch then referring to its currency.</p>    <p>Wilson (ed. 1922): There have been many attempts to emend it, e.g. Theobald reads wear for where, and all mod. edd. follow, ignoring the fact that touching will wear gold flatly contradicts the gold bides still that others touch. We explain the corruption by a cut of two or more rhyming lines [between gold and and No man]. Idem (ed. 1962) withdraws. Baldwin (ed. 1928): If, to mend the meter, we insert an accented monosyllable following and—Theobald suggested so—the line still fails to make sense. . . .  The contrast is clearly between the easily tarnished enamel and the enduring gold. Adriana has just previously pointed out that, while she suspects the eye of Antipholus of doing homage elsewhere, yet she can endure that, if only he be not false to his marriage bed. The number of others who touch him merely in the way of good fellowship and flirtation will tarnish the beauty of the enamel indeed, but will not injure the true gold, however often it may be touched. The application would be that, if Antipholus is true gold, the enamel of reputation may indeed be tarnished, but the gold of character will not be affected. We thus need a condition to begin line 112 [388], that condition being present in Where, which accordingly would appear to be the correct word. . . .  We must have a word which can naturally be more heavily accented than gold. This principle rules out all the suggested words except abides, resides, is there. He prefers abides.</p>     <p>Sisson (1956, 1:91): Alexander retains the Folio reading, re-punctuated, in particular with a semicolon after Where gold, presumably in the sense that others touch and, often touching, will touch where there is gold to touch . . . .  READ:that the gold bides still That others touch, yet often touching will Wear gold, and no man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.  This gives a clear and continuous sense and thought in natural sequence. Yt, here read yet in line [386] in Folio, is a common form for that. Where for Wear is perhaps less obvious, and for yet inexplicable, unless the yet was attracted by the preceding line. Foakes (ed. 1962): The passage contrasts an enamelled surface which wears away in use, with the gold underneath, which still wears gold, i.e. remains [OED, v.1 15]; the implication is a double one, for as jewel refers to herself, Adriana laments that she has lost her beauty (cf. l. [365] above), and goes off (ll. [390–1]) to weep away what’s left of it, while feeling that her true worth remains intact; as jewel refers to Antipholus, Adriana seems to say that although he wears away his outward attractions in the service of other women, his true value as her husband cannot be violated by falsehood or corruption, or, as Baldwin puts it, the enamel of reputation may indeed be tarnished, but the gold of character will not be affected. I assume that shame is a noun, used here in the phrase to do shame, to inflict injury, as at Tw.N., III.iv.[366; 1886], Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame [OED, sb. 3a].</p>    <p>This lengthy explanation still does not do justice to the ambiguity of syntax in ll. [387–9], where often touching will Wear gold could mean that gold does wear away [OED, v.1 9a]; Tilley cites this passage in relation to a phrase, Gold by continual wearing wasteth (I 92). . . .  This contradiction of the obvious sense registers Adriana’s doubt even as she tries to reassure herself about her husband. Baldwin (1962, pp. 141 ff.; rpt. slightly changed in Genetics, 1965, pp. 171 ff.): A modern reader needs only suitable punctuation between gold and and ([388]) to set off the two halves of the simile. Failure to recognize this technical structure has been the cause of all our woe. . . . </p>    <p>The conjunctive and . . . is certainly correct, joining the two parts of the simile. This . . . in turn clears the conclusion of the simile. Most of the rest of the premise also falls naturally into place. . . .  The difficulty is in the immediately following lines:   . . . and often touching will, Where gold and no man that hath a name, By falsehood and corruption doth it shame. <387–9>  As the text stands, will must be completed grammatically by the next precedent verb, bides. In that case, often touching becomes the object, and the statement becomes: gold will bide often touching. Then Where gold becomes the condition—if it really is gold. The comma following will is in keeping with this interpretation, whereas if often touching is taken as the subject, and Where is replaced by Wear, then the line should run on, without a comma, as does the preceding line, with which it rhymes. Theobald’s suggested Wear (after Warburton) reverses the grammatical structure which is bolstered by the punctuation.</p>    <p>Wright & LaMar (ed. 1963): It is possible that the confusion is a deliberate reflection of Adriana’s jealous state of mind. She seems obsessed with the idea that she has lost her beauty and her husband’s regard; at the same time she is bitter about what she considers his misconduct. She equates herself with a mere beautiful ornament, whose value depends on its fresh appearance, while her husband is like a gold coin, which does not depreciate in value despite much handling by many hands.</p>    <p>Wells (ed. 1972) on 385–8: The present edition assumes that behind these lines lies the following meaning: Even the best-enamelled golden ornament will tarnish. Yet the gold itself retains its value, even though people other than its owner touch it. Nevertheless, frequent touching will wear gold away; similarly, no man’s reputation can remain untainted if he behaves in a corrupt and false manner. In this metaphor the ornament is her husband, who has lost his beauty in her eyes. She admits that he retains value for others, but suggests that this value, too, is liable to dwindle.</p>    <p>But this interpretation is in itself faulty, since the jewel could be interpreted as Adriana’s beauty rather than Antipholus’s worth, and in line [387] the word and suggests therefore or moreover rather than nevertheless. It may be that and is erroneous, since it comes again in the following line. The corruption of the passage is such that it is best omitted in performance.</p>    <p>On 387 touching: To touch gold is to test its quality by rubbing it on a touchstone, a process which, if continued, would rub it away.</p>    <p>On 388 Wear gold: I take this to mean wear away gold. But a possible interpretation is remain gold still. If this were adopted, we should have to interpret often touching will | Wear gold as being often tried, or touched (perhaps with some sexual implications [OED, Touch v. 2a]), gold will still remain itself.</p>    <p>Bevington (ed. 1988): Adriana seemingly compares her beauty to that of a well-enamelled jewel that tarnishes in time through neglect, whereas some beauty, like gold, is often touched and hence retains its luster through use; this latter kind of beauty is not shamed through falsehood and corruption by men of name or reputation like Antipholus of Ephesus, as Adriana feels she is being shamed. Dorsch (ed. 1988): <Even> the best-enamelled golden ornament will lose its lustre; yet the gold itself that people other than the owner handle remains all the same; but frequent handling will wear away <even> gold, and there is no man with a reputation that is not soiled by falsehood and corruption.</p>    <p>Taylor (1988, pp. 200, 204, 215–17) makes the most detailed analysis, subjecting the passage to extensive lexical, syntactic, and metrical examination. Of no man that hath a name, By falsehood and corruption doth it shame: R. A. Foakes and other male commentators have defended this statement, but as it stands the generalization is not only false but wildly uncharacteristic of Adriana. According to Foakes, Adriana is saying that Antipholus’s true value as her husband cannot be violated by falsehood and corruption; this paraphrase is logically and morally obnoxious, and difficult to extract from the words of the text. . . .  In Foakes’s interpretation Adriana’s speech is unimpeachably orthodox, hence wholly uncharacteristic of her and unintelligible in the light of Luciana’s rebuke, i.e., Luciana surely doesn’t hear the import of Foakes’s paraphrase.</p>    <p>The first two and a half lines . . . are thus complex, but coherent and intelligible. The jewel/gold is a metaphor for women. The difference between the first proposition and the second, between loose and bides still, depends upon whether the jewel/woman is touched, taken care of, cherished. Antipholus’s neglect of precisely such attention was the theme of Adriana’s preceding speech. Taylor’s notion of touching as caring for is hard to find OED authority for.</p>    <p>Adriana’s reasoning could be paraphrased thus: I see that the best enameled ornament (like a woman) will lose its beauty (if neglected)—yet a golden ornament (or a woman) that others touch and cherish will remain beautiful; and gold (like a woman) loses its value if touched too often—but a man, however false and corrupt, never loses his reputation.</p>    <p>If this interpretation is correct, then in line [387]—in the middle of the middle line of this conceit—Adriana takes up and expands upon one of the terms of her previous metaphor: she revises her own image. What prompts this shift of thought, verbally, is the unintended ambiguity of the phrase others touch, which can suggest (sexual) contact with more than one partner. What prompts this shift, dramatically, is Adriana’s own jealousy, her recurrent complaint that others have touched Antipholus. Women lose their beauty, if neglected; on the other hand, if they are touched too often, they lose their value. But men, however licentious, keep their rank and reputation. Adriana first develops a conceit on brooch-as-woman . . . ; she then, abandoning that conceit, contrasts the predicament of women which it had bodied forth with the unfair invulnerable liberty of men. This passage, this speech, this scene, analyzes the sexual double standard. He changes his to hir, a common compositor’s misreading.</p>    <p>Errors tend to come in batches. . . .  Compositor C was more prone than his fellow compositors to omission, especially in verse (as here), especially of minor parts of speech (like yet); he elsewhere—as with his for correct hir—reversed the gender of pronouns (LLL 537/2.1.60); most of the known substitutions in his work might (like Where for correct Weare) be due to memorial confusion (O’Connor, [1977], 60–61, 69–70). Of course, we would all prefer not to emend the text at all if we could avoid it. But if the logic of the preceding analysis is correct, hir and Weare and yet not only make better sense of the passage than any previous interpretation, but provide the only reconstruction which the logic of the lines and their context will permit. He might have added to the batches the alone, a loue (383) just preceding the passage at hand.</p>    <p>Greenblatt et al. (ed. 1997): A difficult passage, possibly owing to omitted lines. The general idea is that reputation, like gold, withstands corruption and yet may be worn away. Her husband’s infidelities have not tarnished his name, but they may diminish her substance. This is hard to follow: is her substance the same as her reputation (name), when name is apparently the man’s reputation? The chief benefit of Taylor’s version is that it is actable; the actor can make the necessary gestures of discovering the sexist implications of touching, whereas other readings seem much too complicated to get across to an audience in the few seconds available to speak the lines. The possibility that it (389) refers to the Iewell and beauty (as with Bevington above) yields: No decent man who possesses a good reputation will shame something so valuable as a jewel/wife—but that’s what has happened to me. The natural antecedent of it is, of course, name, but worse dislocations than that are common in Sh. This version is likewise actable, with a sufficient pout and self-pointing finger at it.</p>  "},

It must either be, I live unstained; or else, with a disjunction, dis-stained. Theobald (ed. 1733): To stain, defile, pollute [OED, v. 2]. But the Context requires a Sense quite opposite [continuing substantially as above]. Eds. argue whether there is any way to save the F reading, most adopting unstained. Dyce (ed. 1864) believes that the compositor (C) mistook the original v for d, the proneness of printers to blunder in words beginning with v [being] very common, citing MM 2.1.39 (493), Dr. Faustus (Q 1604 daunt, later Qq vaunt) plus several more from the so-called Beaumont and Fletcher plays. Cuningham (ed. 1907) finds distain in R3 5.3.322 (3791) and in Tro. 1.3.241 (701) but notes that the participle does not occur in the plays, whereas unstained is common. Foakes (ed. 1962): Dis-tain’d (unstained) . . . would be tempting if it could be differentiated from distain’d (= stained), but I do not see how an actor could put across a coinage identical in sound but opposite in meaning to a common word; in any case the parallelism of the line seems to require a word beginning with un.

Wells (ed. 1972): It is just possible that distained, meaning dishonoured, is correct, and that Adriana is saying that by committing adultery her husband makes a whore of his wife while keeping his own honour unsullied. Werstine MS finds the primary definition of distain in Palsgrave (1530) to be change the colour of a thing: Thus distaine could mean to remove stain, one way of changing the color of a thing, citing (OED, v. 3) as in 1 Tamburlaine 3.2.64–5: Thence rise the tears that so distain my cheeks, Fearing his love through my unworthynesse [ed. 1973, 1:110], where Zenocrate means that she is pale with fear.

Baldwin (1944, 1:737), tracing Sh.’s grammar school training in Latin, finds it a commonplace: So the elm and vine, which had been entwined in classic times, continue intertwined in Shakspere as everywhere else. Demetz (1958) covers the elm-ivy topos from Catullus to the end of the 19th c.: Side by side with the parallel of amorous vine and ivy, however, there appears the antithetical combination of the motifs. In this antithesis elm and ivy as signs of marital bliss and fertility (suggested by Catullus’ Carmen LXII) are contrasted with the sexual relationship of the ivy clinging to its tree (as in Carmen LXI). In [Err.] . . . Adriana . . . tries to persuade him to return home by contrasting marital fidelity with the dangerous ivy of marital betrayal: [quotes 567–74]. In this admonition the rightful union of husband and wife is suggested by the essential communication of the weak vine and strong elm, which need each other to bear fruit; the usurping ivy, however, implies that disloyalty which seeks the selfish and sterile (idle) pleasures of sex. The ivy, like a vampire, lives on the tree and, unchecked by social decorum (pruning), drains away his life and infects his sap with carnal passion, if not with foul disease.

Cuningham (ed. 1907), since ouphes appears only in Wiv., but elves in MND, Wiv., and Tmp.: I think the balance of probability inclines in favour of the reading elves. . . . It is difficult to see any connection between fairy land (which expression is really the governing factor of the passage) and owls. The latter were repellent to the fairies [quoting MND 2.2.5–6 (655–6)]. . . .  We talk must imply a conversation with fairies, i.e. beings of human shape. Wilson (ed. 1922) finds ouphes . . . very attractive, since oufes and oules might be confused in the MS. . . .  Yet Dromio is surely thinking of spirits in human form. Wilson’s suggested similarity between oufes and oules is unlikely because f in secretary hand has a descender. Foakes (ed. 1962): [Since] owls are incongruous in this passage, I have adopted elves (F2), as being a more natural word in the context, a common Shakespearian word, and also a form from which the reading of F might easily derive.

Screech-owl is their name (tr. Frazer, 1931, p. 329). Werstine MS notes that Sh. used the Fasti as a source for Luc. Halliwell (ed. 1854) quotes two dictionaries, Baret [1573]: A shrich owle, a witch that chaungeth the favor of children, an hagge or fairie, and Thomas Thomas, Dictionarium linguae Latinae et Anglicanae (1596), which paraphrases Ovid. Dorsch (ed. 1988): [Foakes] is not convincing in justifying his emendation elves on the grounds that the compositor saw olwes [sic] in the MS. . . .

The metaphors drawn from food as sexual activity and of entering a door as penetration are denied because Luciana is S. Antipholus’s food (852), and breaking down the door is not applicable to him, but to his brother. It is a commonplace in Shakespeare’s plays that the actions of the servant replicate the actions of their masters, so Dromio’s abhorrence of Luce (945) matches S.

Very few commentators remark on the possibility of incest, though Sh. would have found the prohibition in the Table of Prohibited Degrees usually hanging in the church porch; the prohibitions forbade marriage to a sister-in-law, but the then-current definition of incest prohibited intercourse . . . within the degree within which marriage is prohibited.

The conjecture of Collier [1853], altering ass to face, is a sad weakening of the line, and [Wilson, ed. 1922, p. 81] was the first, with [his] brilliant suggestion of an aim (= butt or mark) [OED, sb. 6] for a name, to show what the point of the line probably is (cf. Kökeritz [1953], p. 90). Dover Wilson noted that Dromio is referring to his recent experiences, to the changing of his name for that of an ass at [633–7], and to the beatings he received from Antipholus at [247 ff.] and from Adriana at [354], which have made him an aim or target for blows; he also drew attention to the similar quibbling jests on ell and nell [900–1], and ears and years [1311]. He retained . . . face, which is here emended to office; face has no antecedent, whereas name recalls Dromio’s opening words in this speech [quotes 673–4], and it is natural to assume that he is still speaking about these things three lines later. Palaeographically, this is not too difficult, especially if the initial o was a mere dot; the change of an aime to a name is easily explicable as a minim misreading. Wells & Taylor (ed. 1986) simplify the minim misreading by emending to ame, a form of aim in the 13th–17th c. Halliwell (ed. 1854), White (ed. 1857), and Irving & Marshall (ed. 1888) echo Collier (1853, p. 81), face for asse: Another change for the better, both as regards the rhyme and the sense. Wilson (ed. 1962) compares R3 4.4.90 (2860). Wells (ed. 1972): As it stands it might mean You would have been willing to exchange your face (identity) for someone else’s name (so as to evade blame), or your name for that of an ass (as an acknowledgement of the reality of the situation). . . . Certainly puns are to be suspected in a passage like this; ass rhyming with place suggests one on an ass and an ace, though the joke would seem neither clear nor very uproarious. Wells & Taylor (1987, p. 267), reading pate: Dromio’s face is not the target of his master’s and mistress’s anger, which is repeatedly aimed at his pate. . . . The conjectured c/t misreading is common; for p/f compare Hamlet 5.2.9 [fall 3276; press variant paule]. The error might also have been assisted here by assimilation to place at the end of 3.1.46 [676].</p>  "},

Dyce (ed. 1857): This entrance and Adriana’s (706) may lead us to suspect that both maid and mistress made their appearance on the balcony termed the upper stage, though they undoubtedly were supposed not to see the persons at the door. Wilson (ed. 1922), supposing the scene is clearly arranged for a public playhouse with upper and inner stages, locates S. Dromio behind the door or curtain at the back of the inner-stage, while Luce and Adriana would appear on the balcony which overhangs the inner-stage. He complains that the within of eds. since Rowe would puzzle the audience with three unseen characters, more especially as one of them [Luce] appears nowhere else in the play. Yet he thinks that Gray’s Inn hall probably had no balcony, making within necessary; the present screen has a balcony, and Gray’s Inn tradition is that it was a gift from Queen Elizabeth after the Armada, but there is no firm evidence as to when it was installed (Caplan, 1988). Though Luce-Nell does not appear elsewhere in the play (and perhaps not here), she becomes a regular onstage presence in the 19th c.; see, e.g., . Elliott (1939–40, p. 102): Sh. refrains from bringing Nell onto the stage in person. The temptation to do so must have been great; the scene would have rejoiced the hearts of ninety percent of his audience. Mahood (1992, p. 6): The people inside apparently make no attempt to look out [though some eds. want her to appear]. But such devices impose upon the tireman the hard job of padding out a little scrubby boy in order to present Luce as a mountain of flesh. . . .

Steevens (ed. 1793): Expect, citing Ant. 2.1.38–9 (662–3); OED (v. 3). Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821), noting that trow makes a triplet, says that Steevens’s gloss is beside his point of a lost line in which the speaker threatened Luce with the corporal correction of a rope, which might have furnished the rhyme now wanting. In a subsequent scene he puts the threat which I imagine was made here into execution, quoting 998–9. White (ed. 1857), supporting Malone, adds that 694–7 are not only without point, but actually without a subject. Keightley (Expositor, 1867, p. 92) provides the missing line: I thought to have ask’d you, had you brought a rope.—I ask’d you to let us in, and you said, No. Halliwell (ed. 1854): A line, without its corresponding rhyme, in comical doggrel . . . , is not without precedent, without examples.

Dromio of Syracuse follows this up by remarking that she has already said no to the question Antipholus asks—see l. [683–4]. I take it that as he questions, Antipholus beats on the door, and receives mental blows in the form of saucy retorts as a return for his physical blows; this would explain blow for blow, l. [696–7].

It is tempting to restore bud, and to take hairs as the antecedent of there. Wells (ed. 1972): The image [bed] seems a little far-fetched, and, as bed is an emendation . . . must be somewhat suspect.

These meteors were thought to develop from two sorts of evaporation drawn up from the earth’s surface by the sun: a hot and dry exhalation potentially like Fire, and a warm and moist vapour potentially like Water. . . .

Delius (ed. 1858): To season goes with owes more. Time, considered in the abstract and general, owes to the particular, actual moment more than he can pay (Ger.). Schmidt (1875, Season subst. 3): Fit and convenient time. . . .  [Time] is seldom so convenient and opportune as one could wish, hence = opportunity. Kökeritz (1953, p. 144) rhyming Season-Seisin: [Dromio] is probably quibbling on seisin to confiscate. Seisin is pronounced season, which however rhymes with Reason (perhaps = raisin) here and at 443. Cercignani (1981, p. 262) calls Kökeritz’s rhyme unreliable. Foakes (ed. 1962): Possibly A term or session of court . . .  (O.E.D., sb. 7) . . . seizing, cf. stealing, l. [1175] seems a better possibility. Salgādo (1972, p. 89): [Possibly] time has so exhausted itself that it’s more trouble than it’s worth to set it straight (season neatly combining the two usual senses of bring to maturity and make palatable or agreeable). Alternatively, if we are not too snobbish to credit the lower orders with quasi-metaphysical intuitions, S. Dromio may be saying that time in itself is empty and owes all its powers and more to season, the harmonious cyclical regularity of the natural world. Wells (ed. 1972) thinks neither seisin nor seizing makes a good joke: Perhaps there is a double pun on Time/thyme and season as season (of the year) and seasoning [quoting Salgādo]. Slights (1986, p. 24): Dromio is making a distinction between time as a natural phenomenon beyond human control, and good time or season which refers to the human organization of time for certain purposes. . . .  He is not denying time’s importance but insisting that its significance derives from artificial human arrangements—in this case his master’s apparent arrest and the law that requires any Syracusian caught in Ephesus to pay a heavy fine or forfeit his life. Time . . . is bankrupt because it is indebted to season (i.e. the occasions appointed by people for certain purposes) for more worth or value than it intrinsically has. Dorsch (ed. 1988) thinks Kökeritz’s seisin very likely in view of the many law terms in Err.</p>  "},

Dromio is surprised to see his master free from the sergeant who arrested him in 4.1 (1067). The first attempts to explain the line depend on emendation (see textual note 1197), the second on explaining puns. Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols, 1817, 2:296) on of old Adam, i.e., of the now-missing bailiff: Adam, you know, went naked; which the vulgar call, in his buff. The bailiffs went array’d formerly in coats of buff: so that this additional buff, I presume, he means by the new apparel of Adam. Theobald (ed. 1733): But why is the Officer call’d old Adam new apparell’d? The Allusion is to Adam in his State of Innocence going naked; and immediately after the Fall, being cloath’d in a Frock of Skins. Thus he was new-apparell’d: and in like manner the Sergeants of the Counter were formerly clad in Buff, or Calves-Skin, as the Author humourously a little lower calls it [1202]. Singer (ed. 1826): Dromio asks Antipholus if he had got him new apparell’d, i.e. got him a new suit, in other words got rid of him. Wilson (ed. 1922) objects that get rid of was not idiomatic until 1665. Cuningham (ed. 1933, p. vii): Quit is the natural expression of one who has brought money for this purpose. Compare [26]. Weld (1956, pp. 454–6) considers the meaning of new apparel’d: Can it, as it must in Theobald’s reading . . . refer to the skins with which God clothed Adam and Eve after the Fall [Gen. 3:21]? If so, [it] means the sergeant, who in his leather coat is the picture of Adam in his new skins. Then, somehow, in Theobald’s fashion or another, we must emend the line to get rid of Adam. . . .  [But this] reading is at odds with common understanding of the Bible. From Patristic times, commentators agree that the skins symbolize the condition of fallen, or the old man. As such, they point a contrast with the New Adam, Christ—the wedding garment clothing the redeemed. On the one hand . . . It pleased God to cloath man . . . to put him in minde of mortalitie, by his cloathing of dead beasts skinnes [Andrew Willet, Hexapla in Genesin, London, 1608, pp. 54–5]. . . . On the other hand stands the Apostolic injunction to put off the old man and put on the new [Eph. 4:22–4; see ]. . . .  The contrast . . . is that between the unregenerate part of our nature, symbolically dressed in the old halter and badge of our desert to die, and the new garment which defends us from death, hell, and damnation. To speak of old Adam as newly dressed in the symbol of the fact that he is not the New Adam, but the Old, would require of the audience a most peculiar erudition. Weld summarizes the virtual morality play . . . the whole action of Antipholus’ arrest into the terms of bondage to sin, damnation, and redemption [proposed by Wilson, ed. 1922, at 1142]. . . .  The dramatic treatment of the whole episode in these two scenes . . . is an elaborate play upon the moral analogy of man contending with the world, the flesh, and the devil. Within this moral analogy the line must shape its meaning. A partial sense, at least, may be caught in the wretched clumsiness of paraphrase: What, have you got the sergeant, who in his leather coat symbolized your unregenerate nature, new clothed as liberator? Wells & Taylor (1987, p. 268): [Alice] Walker noted that One would expect a punning allusion to redemption [1156] . . . as a link between the gold for which he has been sent and the following old Adam.

Fob, at this time of day, means—a put-off, a delay accompany’d with slight; a sense not corresponding with any thing in the passage in question: [Hanmer, ed. 1744] has—bob; meaning, probably,—tap on the shoulder; for bob is a stroke, though not of that sort: but fob may as well have that sense put upon it, as take the other in one so constrain’d. Dyce (1844, p. 29): As Mr. Collier retained sob, he ought to have explained what it means in this passage. Idem (ed. 1857): Mr. Halliwell, in his Dict. of Arch. and Prov.

So the Dromio begins his lament for being beaten with a pun, twisting his master’s indignant Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass: I am an ass indeed; you may prove it by my long ears (years)[], then launches an extremely balanced antithetical account of his master’s zeal: [quotes 1313–15] which he ends with another pun: nay . . . door. The extreme symmetry here gives to the subject-matter a witty dimension which it might otherwise not have had, for the exact return of the parallel antitheses in the style mimics the inevitable nature of the beating—it is a stylistic mimesis of that form of humour in which man is made to seem mechanical. Turner (1974, p. 181): The insistent rhythms . . . create an intensity that appears to claim from us a response more intimate than detachment. . . .  Dromio’s speech exaggerates the plight of the servant with a conscious exuberance to generate by its very energy laughter in the audience. Still, it is hard not to accept the possibility that the playwright aims at affecting more than our sense of impropriety. In short, Dromio’s speech brings out the strong sense of injustice from the point of view of the victim to implicate and slightly discomfort us. Berry (1988, p. 22): They [the Dromios] seem used to it [their beatings], and I don’t intend to invoke later standards. It is a given of the play that the beating-up of servants is funny, and so it is, if you take the Dromios as mere dramatic fictions, two-dimensional cartoon figures. But once, a Dromio is given a longer speech to mark his sense of things [quotes]. It is a disturbing reminder of the human being behind the cartoon.

Pinch, derived from the medicus of Menaechmi, is turned into a familiar folk figure, the schoolmaster–cunning man, whose Latin education permitted him to converse with ghosts and exorcise demons; he is also alleged to be one of Sh.’s pedants like Holofernes, but the similarities are few. Steevens (ed. 1778): In many country villages the pedagogue is still a reputed conjurer. Singer (ed. 1826): As learning was necessary for an exorcist, the schoolmaster was often employed. Lloyd (in Idem, ed. 1856, 2:82), writing about Sh.’s move from Plautus’s Epidamnus to Ephesus: Another coincidence with the profession of Pinch as a schoolmaster at Ephesus, [is] the mention in the passage of Acts referred to [19:9], of the school of one Tyrannus (see ). Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary, Conjurer) cites Ham. 1.1.42 (54). Greg (1942; 1954, p. 140 n.): There is nothing in the text to suggest that he was a schoolmaster. . . .  The insistence on his name and appearance . . . seems to me quite pointless unless the audience were meant to recognize an actual person. . . .  Was this another of Sincklo’s impersonations? Foakes (ed. 1962) adds 2H6 4.2.84 ff. (2395 ff.): Jack Cade’s rebels condemn the Clerk of Chatham, a scholar and school teacher, as a conjurer because he can read. Shakespeare develops the figure of a comic pedant in Shr. and L.L.L. (Holofernes); for the background to this type of character [in commedia dell’arte], see K. M. Lea, Italian Popular Comedy, II.393ff., though Lea does not include Pinch in her discussion of the pedant. Foakes: So called because of his hungry, lean fac’d look, cf. [1715 ff.]. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, pp. 37–46) sees the satiric treatment of Pinch as being generated by anti-Catholic sentiment against the Jesuits, who claimed they converted or reconciled 4,000–5,000 souls in the 1580s on the basis of successful exorcisms. Baldwin draws chiefly on Samuel Harsnett, A discouery of the fraudulent practices of [John] Darrel (1599) and A declaration of egregious popish impostures (1603), but notes that Harsnett describes activities in the 1580s as well as later. Wells (ed. 1972): His title of Doctor alludes to his qualification as a schoolmaster, not a physician. Milward (1973, p. 53) thinks that Sh. took the name from R.

Foakes (ed. 1962) best summarizes the issues: Alluding to two jokes of the time; one was the substitution of respice funem (a rope, i.e. hanging) for the common tag respice finem (think on your end), cf. Nashe’s attack on [Gabriel] Harvey in Four Letters Confuted (1592; McKerrow, I. 268), to bee . . . bid Respice funem, looke backe to his Fathers house (Harvey’s father was a ropemaker), and see Tilley, E 125, [Remember (Mark) the End]. The other relates to the habit of teaching parrots to cry rope, and Shakespeare’s immediate source was probably Lyly, cf. Midas, I.ii.45, she wil crie walke knave, walke. Then I will mutter, a rope for Parrat, a rope [ed. 1902, 3:120] (this occurs in a passage which Shakespeare seems to echo earlier, . . . and Mother Bombie, III.iv.54 ff., where the parrot’s cry A Rope is referred to in a context relating to hanging [ed. 1902, 3:201]. For further comment, and the probable source of the joke about the rope’s end, see T. W. Baldwin [1948, pp. 141–55]. Warburton (in Theobald, ed. 1733) suggests an allusion: To the last Words of a famous satirical Pamphlet, wrote at that time [1570] by [George] Buchanan against the Lord of Liddington in Scotch, ending with these Latine Words, Respice finem, respice funem. As for the Phrase, the Prophecy like the Parrot, We are to remember, the London tradesmen of that time were very fond of this new exotic Bird, because he could speak. . . .  In teaching him the Lingua, ’twas no Wonder they should delight themselves in giving him many knavish Words, as rope, Scot. &c. to the Offence of many of his Majesty’s Northern Subjects. . . .  However the Word Rope . . . was the most common Word in his Language; and, no doubt, the most offensive. And the joke was this; when the Parrot had bespatter’d any One with it, for the wise Owner to say to the offended Passenger, Sir, take care; my Parrot prophesies. The pamphlet Warburton refers to without naming, Chamaeleon, was not printed until 1710 (see Buchanan, 1892, pp. 37–53). Cuningham (ed. 1907) first identifies the quotations from Lyly: The phraseology of this passage is a clear indication of Shakespeare’s early manner. He no doubt refers to [Lyly, as in Foakes above]. Cuningham credits Craig (Gen. Ed.) for the quotation from Nashe’s Four Letters Confuted. Baldwin (1967, p. 11) finds Finis and Funis in Lyly’s (anonymous) Marprelate tract Pappe with an Hatchet (1589), D4v: Here I was writing Finis and Funis and determined, to lay it by. Lancashire (1969, pp. 237–41) proposes sexual puns on intercourse and penis in the passages from Midas and Mother Bombie cited above (walk = intercourse, rope = penis). She adds: For Elizabethans, it became a familiar pun to put the two phrases together, as Shakespeare does [here], and thus to refer to the human posterior, or end, and the end of a rope, with which men were whipped. Beware your end, beware the rope’s end! . . . Here, then, we have the association of rope, and rope’s end, with the buttocks; and the logical extension of the pun to give it a sexual meaning is surely something the quick-witted, pun-conscious Elizabethans would not have missed. Shakespeare . . . probably means the pun to be sexual when he uses it in The Comedy of Errors. Dromio . . . has brought a rope’s end with which Antipholus . . . intends to beat his wife; and the pun on her end and whipping is clear; but implications of sexual intercourse are probably also very much present. Wells (ed. 1972): Dromio is ruefully warning Adriana of the use to which Antipholus means to put the rope. He evidently means merely a whipping.</p>  "},

McKerrow, Nashe, i, 271–2: I borrowed this sentence out of a Play. The Theater, Poets hall, hath many more such prouerbes etc. The sentence Nashe borrowed: So Hares may pull dead Lions by the beards, is from The Spanish Tragedy 1.2.172, as McKerrow notes. The context, on sigs. G4–4v (the heart . . . money phrase is on G4v), reinforces the likelihood of influence because it contains a reference to a physician, Dr. William Butler; the word coniure; and He had his grace to be Doctor ere he died. . . .  In Norfolke where hee practised, he was reputed a proper toward man at a medecine for the toothake, & one of the skilfullest Physitions . . . that euer came there (ed. McKerrow, 1:300–1). Baldwin (ed. 1928) believes that Nashe was borrowing from Err.: But there is a still earlier variant of the expression than Nashe’s. In Thomas Lodge’s Deafe Man’s Dialoge (S.R., February 17, 1592; but if really by Lodge, written before August 26, 1591) we find  . . . but neuer a rag of money [M1v]. It seems either that Shakespeare adapted the saying accurately to his context and that Nashe is echoing him, or that Shakespeare originated the expression and that Lodge has adapted it to his context, instead of echoing it as did Nashe. In the latter case, we should have evidence that The Comedy was in existence by August, 1591. But it cannot be shown that the expression occurs only in the work of these writers.</p>  "},

This sense of copia is fully covered by Baldwin (1944, 2:176–96) on the Erasmian copia verborum learned in grammar schools, the art of elaborating topics: Shakspere knew the meaning of copy [he quotes 1531–6]. Adriana had evidently been quite copious upon this subject of her theme, as every grammar school boy was expected to be. Steevens (ed. 1778), perhaps influenced by Theame (1534), starts another line of glossing that continues to the present day: I.e. the theme. We still talk of setting copies for boys. But this sense is not confirmed by OED; rather it says (sb. 11b): Copy of a conference: memorandum or minutes of a conference; also app. the agenda or subject matter; the theme, quoting only this line and N. Udall, Diotrephes, 1588, Gave his friende a copie of his conference. The inadequacy of definition 11b for Err. seems clear. Hulme (1977, pp. 278–9) discusses OED definitions that are probably wrong, where evidence of Shakespearean context points strongly to senses not directly confirmed by [OED’s] authority. She quotes 1524–37: The arrangement of the dramatic dialogue directs us to understand the main sense of copy as that of the Latin copia, plenty, in swift rejoinder to the reproach of not enough [1530]. . . .  [OED] indeed shows this [plenty] as one of the earliest senses of the word, but for this actual phrase in Shakespeare’s text offers the definition agenda or subject matter [etc., as above]; a number of recent editors following the Dictionary give this possible secondary sense as their only gloss.

To slash with a knife. The frequent emendation scotch, beginning with Hanmer, is traced in the textual note. Defenders of scorch (OED, v.1: To heat to such a degree as to shrivel) usually point to brands of fire (1644), e.g., Heath (1765, p. 201). Defenders of scotch such as Cuningham (ed. 1907) point to Mac. 3.2.13 (1167) where F scorch’d is famously emended by Theobald to scotch’d. Although Cuningham supports scotch’d, citing the misprint of Mac., he notes that scotch is only used by Shakespeare in later plays such as Macbeth and Coriolanus; scorch in early plays, e.g., 3H6, Jn. Wilson (ed. 1922): The F. reading suggests the entry of Antipholus and Dromio with burning brands at l. [1665], which makes an effective tableau. Tannenbaum (1932, p. 124): Because he thinks that . . . scorch means burn or singe, Professor Wilson instructs Antipholus and Dromio to enter . . . with burning brands. . . .

Roberts (1983, p. 112 n.) observes that Foakes has mistakenly compared Warner’s translation of Menaechmi 840–1, where a burning lampe is indeed the weapon (Apollo commands me) with the Latin of Menaechmi 848, which translates as you [Apollo] bid me not to spare my fists. The Latin of 840–1 is Ecce: Apollo mi ex orclo imperat, | ut ego illi oculos exuram lampidibus ardentibus (Lo! Apollo from his oracle doth bid me burn her eyes out with blazing brands [tr.

Wilson (ed. 1922): Capell transposed the speech on the ground that her urging of the wrack is unsupported by anything in Æmilia’s first speech.

The Duke’s here begins shows that he seizes upon the resemblance as soon as Æmilia commences her story, while her second speech appears to continue the account of the wrack which should have been begun in her first. We are indebted for this solution to a suggestion by Dr W. W. Greg. Foakes (ed. 1962) objects: This is pressing the matter of the wreck hard; I find it difficult to believe that an audience, knowing from Act I all about the shipwreck, would be troubled by the slight inconsistency here. The point surely is that Shakespeare reminds us of Egeon’s story without allowing Emilia to repeat what is well known. If any difficulty is felt, the simplest solution would be to emend her urging (l. [1835]) to his urging, as Collier suggested. Werstine (1980, pp. 393–4), noting that Compositor B, the most trustworthy of the three compositors who set Err., never transposed any of the 4,150 lines he set in F from extant printed copy: It becomes difficult to identify the source of the corruption which Capell’s emendation would repair. . . .  [He compares Mason’s and Collier’s pronoun substitutions, prefers Mason’s his urging, and continues.] Yet her wracke is certainly an acceptable reading, for in the play’s first scene Egeon stresses his wife’s suffering as much as his own: [quotes 108–11]. The Duke’s recollection of Egeon’s urging of her wracke would therefore be quite accurate. Naturally the Duke would think of her wracke in his attempt to explain her presence in Ephesus.

But Shakespeare probably did not compute the result of his own figures with any great care or accuracy. Wilson (ed. 1922) The mistake may well be the author’s.

If so, curiosity would seem to have required the rather long period of eight years to kill this cat. Arthos (1972, pp. 36–7): At the end, when the Abbess speaks of the new life that lies before them all after their trials, she uses words of unmistakably Christian reference. Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail, she begins, putting herself in the role of a figure almost like Providence, responsible for the new life they are now to have, but in naming that particular number of years she introduces the unexpected suggestion of the life of Christ. Muir (1977, pp. 97–8): If one adds nine months of actual pregnancy to the twenty-five years of the sons’ age, one still gets only twenty-six; yet the thirty-three years suit the Duke’s testimony, since he would have become Antipholus’s patron, not when he was five, but when he was thirteen. . . .  It is probable that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, and that he wished to achieve particular effects in the two contexts. In the first scene it was important for us to believe that Antipholus went in search of his twin as soon as he reasonably could, and therefore eighteen years of age was more suitable than twenty-six. In the last scene it was necessary to stress the length of time the Duke had known Antipholus of Ephesus, and twenty years was better than twelve. Marcotte (1982, pp. 9–12): In his haste to complete an understandably disagreeable chore [127–9], Egeon does not trouble to describe in detail how Antipholus of Syracuse spent the period of time that elapsed between his eighteenth and twenty-sixth year; nevertheless . . . one of two scenarios is implied, either that S.

Clayton (1973, p. 481) proposes Compositor B’s misreading of Maturity, a matter of mere minims, as well as according with a special emphasis upon the end of the process of gestation at full term. Williams (privately) suggests Maturity on the grounds of compositorial anticipation instead of the commonly argued notion of echo, leading to emending 1896. He cites the duplications at 154 (Compositor C, probably from carrying too much in his memory) and 1835, observing that in each instance the first word is emended: If we imagine that as the compositor [B] set the first line his mind was thinking ahead to Natiuitie in the third line, its second place, and as he was about to set and to displace another word in the first place, then Maturitie in his manuscript would look a good deal like Natiuitie, and the error would have been facilitated by the appearance of the two words. Though the word is not uncommon in Sh., it reappears in Per. 3.1.32 (1147) at the birth of Marina in a tempest, the source being the same Apollonius of Tyre that Sh. uses for the romance plot in Err.

Steevens (ed. 1778): The old reading may be right. She has just said, that to her, her sons were not born till now. Sisson (1956, 1:98): The repetition of the word Nativity, its capitals not to be ignored, is moreover deliberate and emphatic. Nativity suggests not only birth but Christmas, the Feast of the Nativity as Elizabethans commonly spoke of it and wrote it in legal documents. Indeed, Nativity includes the notion of festivity. The nexus of thought and image is perhaps closer than may be generally realized. Advent is a penitential season in the Christian year, the long grief . . . followed by the joys of the day and feast of the Nativity. Finally, the play was acted at a Christmas Feast at Gray’s Inn on 28 December 1594. . . .  Nothing could be more appropriate than this concluding insistence upon the word Nativity and the spirit of the season, which the actors would hopefully emphasize. The capital N is probably one of Compositor B’s emphasis capitals, rather than a reflection of his copy, as Sisson suggests.

Wells (1986, p. 269), on the unfolding mystery in Act 5, suggests how the staging might be done: So it seems that Shakespeare envisaged two sorts of reactions: Adriana’s to the two masters (one of them her husband), and the Duke’s to both pairs of twins. This suggests that the Abbess should enter with the master and servant one on each side of her, and that Adriana should be so placed that both masters are obviously in her view, whereas the Duke can easily see both pairs of twins. . . .  [When Aemilia says 1825–6, recognizing Egeon], this is a trump card for both Shakespeare and Aemilia.
